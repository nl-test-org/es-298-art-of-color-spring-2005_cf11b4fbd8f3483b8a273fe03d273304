Course Description
------------------

This studio seminar first reviews the principles of visual design. It then launches into beginning studio projects that explore the basic principles of using of color in the visual arts. Projects include familiarization with colors, color and value balance, color as expression, color as impression, color squares, color as construction, warm-cold colors, and the interaction of colors. The course also examines the science of color; students study the physics, neuroscience, chemistry, and mathematics of color theory.

Each student works on one large final project dealing with "Interaction of Color," that often includes multi-media uses of color.
